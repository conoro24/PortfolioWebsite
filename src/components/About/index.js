                    About Me
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am a recent Computer Science graduate, looking to 
                    kickstart my career in an established IT company with
                    the opportunity to work with the latest technologies
                    on challenging and diverse projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finished my bachelors with a first class honors degree from 
                    Trinity College Dublin, and am due to officially receive my 
                    degree in November, 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am quietly confident, naturally curious and always
                    looking to improve upon my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had one sentence to describe me, it would be a
                    friendly and personable person, sports fanatic, problem
                    solver and tech-obsessed!!!
